# IN100_HostControllerSample
The Host Controller API is used to control the IN100 in the context of using it with a microcontroller. The IN100 communicates with a host controller through the on chip UART. For the QFN18 packaging, this is GPIO 0 and GPIO 1. In the DFN8 packaging, this is MGPIO 4 and MGPIO 5.
